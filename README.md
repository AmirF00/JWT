# JWT Security Vulnerability Labs üîê

A comprehensive collection of JWT (JSON Web Token) security vulnerabilities for educational purposes. This project demonstrates various attack vectors and common implementation mistakes in JWT authentication.

## üéØ Labs Available

### Lab 1: None Algorithm Vulnerability
Demonstrates how a misconfigured JWT implementation can be exploited using the 'none' algorithm attack.
- Vulnerability: Accepting 'none' as a valid algorithm
- Attack Vector: Algorithm header manipulation
- Impact: Authentication bypass

### Lab 2: Weak Signature Attack
Shows how weak secrets in JWT signatures can be exploited.
- Vulnerability: Using weak secret keys
- Attack Vector: Brute force attack on signature
- Impact: Token forgery

### Lab 3: KID Directory Traversal
Explores how the Key ID header parameter can be exploited for directory traversal.
- Vulnerability: Unsanitized file path in KID header
- Attack Vector: Directory traversal via KID parameter
- Impact: Arbitrary file read, token forgery

### Lab 4: JKU Header Injection
Demonstrates vulnerabilities in JWK Set URL handling.
- Vulnerability: Unvalidated JKU header
- Attack Vector: Malicious JWK Set hosting
- Impact: Token forgery using attacker-controlled keys

## üí• Exploitation Guides

### Lab 1: None Algorithm Attack
1. Login as regular user
2. Get the JWT token
3. Create a new token with:
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIn0.
   ```
4. Use the modified token to access admin data

### Lab 2: Weak Signature Attack
1. Login as regular user
2. Get the JWT token
3. Use hashcat to crack the signature:
   ```bash
   hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 "JWT_TOKEN_HERE" wordlist.txt
   ```
4. Create a new token with admin privileges using the cracked secret

### Lab 3: KID Directory Traversal Attack
1. Login as regular user
2. Get the JWT token
3. Create a new token with modified header pointing to public CSS file
4. Sign the token using the CSS file contents
5. Use the modified token to access admin data

### Lab 4: JKU Header Injection Attack
1. Login as regular user
2. Get the JWT token
3. Create a new token with modified JKU header pointing to malicious JWK Set
4. Sign the token using the malicious JWK Set keys
5. Use the modified token to access admin data

## üîí Security Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This application is deliberately vulnerable and for educational purposes only.

In a production environment, you should:
- Never accept the 'none' algorithm
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets
- Implement proper signature verification
- Validate and sanitize all header parameters
- Implement proper key management
- Use appropriate access controls
